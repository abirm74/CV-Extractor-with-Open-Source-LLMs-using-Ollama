Your task is to extract structured information from the resume below into a strict flat JSON object.

You MUST follow the format and extraction rules exactly as described per field.

Do not include any fields not listed below. If a field is optional and not found, return an empty string "" or empty list [] as specified.

Character replacement rule: If and only if you encounter the exact character `�`, replace only that character with `[UNK]` (including brackets and uppercase letters). Do **not** alter or remove adjacent characters or valid digits. Do **not** change line breaks, bullet points, formatting, or any other text.

Return only valid JSON, without markdown or comments.

OUTPUT JSON FORMAT:
{
  "name": "<Extracted full name — do not infer, must be directly stated.>",

  "mail": "<Extracted email address — OPTIONAL. If not present, return empty string "">",
  "location": "<Extracted city and/or region — must match resume verbatim.>",
  "linkedin": "<Extracted LinkedIn URL — OPTIONAL. If not present, return empty string "">",
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "<Degree name — directly extracted, do not infer.>",
      "university": "<University or institution name — verbatim.>",
      "location": "<City/Location of the university — verbatim.>",
      "duration": "<Date range or period as stated — preserve original format.Replace all � with [UNK].>"
    }
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "<Job title — as written.>",
      "company": "<Company name — do not infer.>",
      "duration": "<Job duration — as listed, preserve format.>",
      "location": "<Location — directly extracted.>",
      "full_description": "<Full job description — MUST preserve full bullet points and line breaks exactly as in resume. Do not paraphrase, compress, or remove formatting. Replace only � with [UNK]. Leave all other characters and formatting untouched.>"
    }
  ],
