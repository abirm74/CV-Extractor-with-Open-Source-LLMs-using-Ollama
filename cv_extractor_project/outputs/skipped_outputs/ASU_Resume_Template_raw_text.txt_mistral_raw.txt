CRITICAL RULES:
--------------------

1. **STRICT FIELD LIMITATION**
   - Do NOT extract or return any other fields.
   - Ignore: Summary, Certifications, Awards, Projects, Interests, Hobbies, GPA, Classes, Honors, etc.

2. **ALIAS MAPPING**
   Accept alternate section headings:
   - "Technical Skills", "Skills Summary", "Tools" → "skills"
   - "Professional Experience", "Work History" → "experience"
   - "Academic Background", "Education History" → "education"

3. **UNREADABLE CHARACTER RULE**
   - Replace every occurrence of � with “[UNK]”
   - Do NOT guess what the character was

   Example:
   Input: �1��234��555�
   Output: [UNK]1[UNK]234[UNK]555[UNK]

4. **MISSING FIELD HANDLING**
   - If any field is missing, output:
     - `""` for strings
     - `[]` for lists

5. **SOURCE STRUCTURE**
   - Do not rearrange content
   - Do not infer structure or context
   - Never interpret a line unless it exactly matches the schema

6. **JSON OUTPUT FORMAT**
   - Output a single valid JSON object ONLY
   - No markdown, no explanations, no field names outside the schema
   - Must be 100% JSON-parseable
   - Top-level keys must match schema exactly: name, location, linkedin, phone, mail, experience, education, skills
   - Do not add any other fields under any circumstance. Violating this will be considered an invalid output.
